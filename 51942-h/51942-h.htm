      THE THREE GODFATHERS
    </h2>
    <p>
      |THE daylight raid on the Wicken-burg National Bank had not been a
      success. It had been well planned, boldly and cleverly executed, and the
      four bandits had gathered unto themselves quite a fortune in paper money;
      the job had been singularly free from fuss and feathers. Nevertheless, as
      has already been stated, the raid was not a success. The assistant
      cashier, returning from luncheon, had, from a distance of half a block,
      observed two strangers in town. Both strangers were mounted and stood on
      guard in front of the Wickenburg National. In an alley just back of the
      bank two saddle horses were standing; and as the assistant cashier paused,
      irresolute, two men came out of the bank, mounted the two horses waiting
      in the alley, and, followed by the men who had been standing on watch in
      front of the bank, rode out of Wickenburg in rather a suspicious hurry.
      The assistant cashier had an inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thieves! Robbers! Stop 'em!&rdquo; he yelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      His hue and cry aroused to action an apparently inoffensive and elderly
      citizen who was taking his siesta in front of The Three Deuces saloon. Now
      this man in front of The Three Deuces was not the sheriff. He was not even
      the city marshal. Rather he inclined one to the belief that he might be a
      minister of the gospel&mdash;a soul-trapper on guard at the portals of The
      Three Deuces, within which, judging by the subdued rattle of poker chips,
      ivory balls and an occasional hoarse shout of &ldquo;Keno!&rdquo; one could be
      reasonably certain of a plethora of brands ripe for the burning. The aged
      citizen asleep in the chair outside was arrayed in somber black, with a
      turn-down collar and white lawn tie, a &ldquo;biled&rdquo; shirt with a ruby stud in
      it, and patriarchial white whiskers. But his coat, of a clerical cut,
      effectually concealed two pieces of artillery of a style and caliber
      popularized by time and tradition in the fair state of Arizona.
    </p>
    <p>
      The four galloping horsemen were abreast The Three Deuces when the cry of
      &ldquo;Robbers!&rdquo; aroused all Wickenburg. It awoke the man in the chair; and he
      came to his feet with the suddenness of a ferocious old dog, filled both
      hands and cut loose at one of the four horsemen. There was a reason for
      this. The elderly citizen had a deposit of three dollars and seventeen
      cents in the Wickenburg National. Also he possessed a fair proportion of
      civic pride, and the horseman upon whom he trained his hardware was
      carrying a gunny-sack containing a pro rata of the said elderly citizen's
      three-seventeen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four Bad Men had ridden into Wickenburg that December afternoon, but only
      three rode out. One of the three had a bullet hole through his left
      shoulder. The man who stayed lay, thoroughly and effectually defunct, on
      top of a bulging gunny-sack in front of The Three Deuces. Came presently
      the paying teller of the Wicken-burg National and removed the gunny-sack.
      Came half an hour later the coroner of Wickenburg and removed the body. As
      for the elderly citizen of deceptive appearance, he walked uptown to a
      hardware store, replenished his supply of ammunition and returned to The
      Three Deuces in a highly cheerful frame of mind. Here let us leave him,
      for with this story he has nothing further to do. From now on our interest
      must center on The Three Bad Men who rode out of Wickenburg headed for the
      California line&mdash;which happens to be the Colorado River.
    </p>
    <p>
      They made their first halt at Granite Tanks, twenty-five miles from
      Wickenburg. Here they watered their horses and then pressed onward toward
      the river. At the river they found a boat, thoughtfully provided for just
      such an emergency as the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darkness had already settled over the land when The Three Bad Men came to
      the Colorado River. It would have been wise on their part to have waited
      until the rising of the moon, but our story does not deal with The Three
      Wise Men. Within the hour a posse might appear, and, moreover, The Three
      Bad Men were of that breed that prefers to &ldquo;take a chance.&rdquo; They rode
      their jaded horses into the flood until the yellow waters lapped their
      bellies; then they shot them and shoved the carcasses off into the
      current.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later The Three Bad Men landed on the California side near Bill
      Williams Mountain, filled their boat with stones and sank it, and
      shouldering a supply of food and water sufficient to last them four days,
      headed up a long box canon that led north to the Colorado Desert. They
      made fair time after the moon came up. All night long they trudged through
      the box canon, and at daylight it opened out into the waste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, boys, I guess we're safe.&rdquo; remarked The Worst Bad Man, who was the
      leader of the trio. &ldquo;It's cooler in the canon, so suppose we camp here. I
      feel like breakfast and some sleep. How's your shoulder, Bill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Wounded Bad Man shrugged the wounded member disdainfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;High up. Missed the bone and don't amount to much, Tom. But I've bled
      like a stuck pig and it's weakened me a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll heat some water and wash it up, Bill,&rdquo; said The Youngest Bad Man,
      much concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      They made a very small fire of cat-claw and ironwood, brewed a pot of
      coffee, breakfasted, washed and dressed The Wounded Bad Man's shoulder and
      slept until late afternoon. They awoke much refreshed, ate an early supper
      and struck out across the desert to the north, where in time they would
      come to the Santa Fe tracks. There were lonely stations out there in the
      sands&mdash;they might be worth investigation. Then on to the new mining
      camp at Old Woman Mountain&mdash;a camp which, following the whimsical and
      fantastic system of desert nomenclature, which seems to trend toward such
      names as Mecca, Cadiz. Bagdad, Bengal and Siam, had had bestowed upon it
      the not inappropriate name of New Jerusalem.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a number of reasons The Three Bad Men preferred to travel by night.
      Primarily they were prowlers and preferred it. Secondly, although one may
      encounter torrid weather by day on the Colorado Desert even in December,
      the nights, on the contrary, are bitterly cold&mdash;and The Three Bad Men
      had no blankets. Also there was this advantage about traveling at night
      and sleeping in the shadow of a rock by day: they would not meet other
      wanderers and there would he no embarrassing questions to answer
      respecting the hole in The Wounded Bad Man's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consequently The Three Bad Men traveled by night. From Mojave Tanks they
      swung west to avoid the mining operations there, although more than once
      they glanced back wistfully at the little cluster of yellow lights shining
      across the sands. The Wounded Bad Man's shoulder was in a bad way and
      needed medical attention. Also they needed water; but they were
      desert-bred and could last until they came to Malapai Springs.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they turned their backs on Mojave Tanks and tramped onward. Now they
      were in the ghostly moonlight of the open desert, with the outlines of the
      mountain ranges on each side looming dim and shadowy fifteen or twenty
      miles away; now they were picking their way carefully through clusters of
      murderous catclaw, through tangles of mesquit and ironwood. Up dark,
      lonely arroyos they went; down long alleys between the outstretched arms
      of the ocatillas with their pendulous, blood-red blossoms, passing dried,
      withered Joshua trees twisted into fantastic shapes as if their fearful
      surroundings had caused them to writhe in horror; through solitude and
      desolation so vast and profound as to inspire one with the thought that
      the Creator, appalled at the magnitude of this abortion of Nature, had set
      it apart as an eternal heritage of the damned.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the forenoon of the fifth day they came to Malapai Springs. Here The
      Three Bad Men drank deeply, bathed, filled their canteens and stepped
      blithely out for Terrapin Tanks, the next water-hole&mdash;a little-known
      and consequently unfrequented spot&mdash;where they could rest for a few
      days before attempting the last desperate leg of their journey to the
      railroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't stint yourself on the water. Bill,&rdquo; The Worst Bad Man advised as
      they departed from Malapai Springs. &ldquo;There's always water at Terrapin
      Tanks.&rdquo; Nevertheless, with the instinct of the desert-bred, The Worst Bad
      Man and The Youngest Bad Man were sparing with the water themselves,
      although careful to conceal this fact from The Wounded Bad Man. The
      latter's shoulder was swollen and inflamed, and it was a relief to him if
      the bandages were kept wet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worst Bad Man, who knew the country better than his companions, had
      timed their arrival at Terrapin Tanks almost to the hour. The sun was just
      coming up over the low red hummocks of hematite to the eastward when The
      Three Bad Men plodded wearily up a long, dry canon, turned a sharp, rocky
      promontory into an arroyo&mdash;and paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Borne on the slight desert breeze a sound came to them from up the arroyo.
      It was a mournful, wailing cry and ended in a sob&mdash;a sound that
      bespoke pain and fear and misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Three Bad Men looked at one another. Each held up an index finger,
      enjoining silence. A second, a third time the sound was repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a human voice,&rdquo; announced The Worst Bad Man, &ldquo;an' there's death in
      it. Wait here. I'm goin' in to see what's up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he had gone The Youngest Bad Man, after the restless and inquisitive
      manner of youth, climbed a tall rock and gazed up the arroyo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see the top of a covered wagon,&rdquo; he announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said The Wounded Bad Man, &ldquo;It's a tenderfoot outfit, an' that's a
      woman cryin'. No desert rat'd come here with a wagon. Fools drive in where
      burros fear to tread. Bob. They're tenderfeet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right,&rdquo; agreed The Youngest Bad Man. &ldquo;Some nester come in over the
      trail from Imperial Valley and bound for New Jerusalem, I'll bet a new
      hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoever's doin' that whimperin' is sure bound for New Jerusalem,&rdquo; The
      Wounded Bad Man replied with a grim attempt at humor. &ldquo;An' if I don't let
      a doctor look at this shoulder o' mine before long I'll head that way
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worst Bad Man was gone about ten minutes. Presently the others saw him
      returning. On his hard, sunscorched face deep concern showed plainly, and
      as he trotted down the arroyo he scratched his unkempt head as if in
      search of an idea of sufficient magnitude to cope with a grave situation.
      When he reached his comrades he sat down on a chunk of black lava and
      fanned himself with his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a line old state of affairs at the Tanks,&rdquo; he said huskily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They ain't dry, are they?&rdquo; Fright showed in the wide blue eyes of The
      Youngest Bad Man. The Wounded Bad Man sat down very suddenly and gulped.
      The Worst Bad Man replied to the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse'n that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Wounded Bad Man sighed. &ldquo;It can't be,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a wagon at the Tanks,&rdquo; continued The Worst Bad Man, &ldquo;but no
      horses. It's a tenderfoot outfit&mdash;a man an' his woman&mdash;an' they
      come in from Salton, via Canon Springs and Boulder, headed for New
      Jerusalem. Some o' their kin has started a boardin' tent in the new camp
      an' these two misfortunates were aimin' to go in with the rush an' clean
      up a stake. They make Terrapin Tanks all right, but the water's a little
      low an' the man ain't got sense enough to dig out the sand an' let the
      water run in. He's one of these nervous city fellers, I guess, and it just
      naturally hurts him to set down an' wait till that sump-hole fills up.
      Besides, he don't take kindly to usin' a shovel, so he sticks in a shot o'
      dynamite to clean out th' tanks an' start the water runnin'&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Wounded Bad Man sprang to his feet, cursing horribly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The damned, crazy fool!&rdquo; he raved. &ldquo;I'll kill him, I will. I'll kill him
      just as sure as I'm thirsty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worst Bad Man paid no attention to the other's outburst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he stuck in his stick o' dynamite an' it's only a fool's luck he
      didn't blow himself up doin' it. I wisht he had; but he didn't. He just
      put Terrapin Tanks out o' business forever&mdash;cracked the granite floor
      o' that sump-hole an' busted down the sides, an' the water's run out into
      the sand an' the tanks run dry. They'll stay dry. We can have cloudbursts
      in this country from now until I get religion, but them tanks'll never
      hold another drop o' water. That fool tenderfoot's dead, I guess; but he's
      goin' to keep right on killin' people just the same. Men'll keep comin'
      here, bankin' on water&mdash;an' in five years there'll be a dozen
      skeletons round that busted tank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But all that ain't what's bitin' me half as hard as what he went an' done
      next. He went an' let his stock nose round an' lick up that alkali slop
      below the Tanks, an' drove 'em <i>loco</i>. They took off up the canon,
      huntin' water, with Mr. Man after 'em. That was four days ago an' he ain't
      come back yet; so we don't need to waste no time speculatin' on his case
      an' feelin' sorry for him. It wouldn't 'a been so bad, but he went an'
      left his woman alone at th' Tanks. She had a little water left, so she
      wasn't so bad off until yesterday, when it give out. It's been pretty hard
      on her all alone there&mdash;an' she's a nice little woman too. About
      twenty, I guess, an' heaps too good for the cuss she married. But still
      that ain't the worst&mdash;not by a long shot. She's goin' to have a
      papoose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>What!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Youngest Bad Man and The Wounded Bad Man voiced the horrified
      exclamation in unison; then The Wounded Bad Man sank back against a rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; The Worst Bad Man affirmed huskily, &ldquo;there's a baby due right soon,
      I reckon. She's in a pretty bad fix. I was never married, boys, an' I
      don't know what to do for her&mdash;an' she's cryin', an' prayin', and
      askin' for help, an'&mdash;I&mdash;don't know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worst Bad Man choked and hid his hard face in his hands. He shook like
      a hooked fish. Silence, while The Worst Bad Man fought for control of
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm a tough old bird,&rdquo; he said presently&mdash;&ldquo;I'm an awful tough old
      bird; but I can't go back there alone. You've got to come with me, lads.
      We got to do someth'n' for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned hopefully to The Wounded Bad Man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bill,&rdquo; he said pleadingly, &ldquo;you ought to know somethin' about such cases.
      You do, don't you Bill? Wasn't you married to a half-breed girl down on
      the Rio Colorado somewheres, an' didn't she have kids for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Wounded Bad Man was on the defensive instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's true,&rdquo; he admitted with some, show of reluctance, &ldquo;but then,
      Tom, you know as well as me that Injuns is different. They ain't <i>human</i>,
      an' this here's a white woman&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right.&rdquo; The Youngest Bad Man out of the wisdom of his twenty-two
      summers hastened to Bill's assistance. &ldquo;An' child-bearin' with a white
      woman means doctors an' nurses an' feather beds an' what-all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Wounded Bad Man flashed the youth a grateful glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet that's right, Bob. An' besides, when that woman o' mine had them
      two twins I was doin' a five year stretch in Yuma&mdash;so you can see I
      don't know nothin' about it. All I know is what I've heard. She didn't
      even call a neighbor's woman&mdash;just brings them twins into the world
      one day, an' gets out an' hustles a livin' for 'em the next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; retorted the bedeviled Worst Bad Man, &ldquo;I wasn't tryin' to pass the
      buck. Just a-ruminatin' around for information.&rdquo; He rose wearily. &ldquo;Come
      on,&rdquo; he growled, and led the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Three Bad Men walked up the draw to Terrapin Tanks. In reverential awe
      they stood beside the covered wagon, parted the side curtains and looked
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a straw tick, covered with blankets, lay a woman. She was young, with
      great brown eyes alight with fever and with the luster of approaching
      motherhood. A long braid of brown hair lay across her white breast; she
      moaned in her pain and terror and wretchedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Wounded Bad Man found a tin cup and gave her generously of his all too
      scant supply of water. The Youngest Bad Man got a clean towel out of the
      tail-box, wet it and washed her burning face and hands. The Worst Bad Man,
      whose courage, for all his deviltry, had its limitations, went and sat
      down on the tongue of the wagon and tried to think. But scourged with the
      horror of this most terrible of human travail, he fled up the arroyo out
      of hearing. On the top of one of the little black volcanic hills, from
      which eminence he could look down on the wagon, he stood, active, alert,
      like a mountain sheep on guard, and beckoned to his friends to join him.
      The Youngest Bad Man obeyed his frantic signals, but The Wounded Bad Man
      stayed at the wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got to be easy on me, son, at a time like this,&rdquo; said The Worst
      Bad Man humbly. &ldquo;I'm an awful tough old bird, but I can't stand that. It
      ain't no place for the likes o' me. What's to be done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin' much, I guess.&rdquo; The Youngest Bad Man threw out his hands in
      desperation. &ldquo;Bill says she ain't got a chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took his canteen in both hands and shook it gently; seeing which The
      Worst Bad Man did the same with his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much has Bill got left?&rdquo; he asked anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nary drop. He's been right feverish along o' that hole in his wing, an'
      hittin' his canteen heavy, expectin' to find water in the Tanks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we got about two gallons left,&rdquo; announced The Worst Bad Man
      philosophically, &ldquo;but I see us cuttin' niggerhead cactus before we hit
      another tank. Once in San Berdoo I heard a sky-pilot preachin', an' he
      'lowed that the way o' the transgressor's bound to be hard; but I'm dogged
      if I looked for anythin' half as hard as this. Bill's callin' you, son.
      Better lope back to the wagon. I'll&mdash;I&mdash;guess I'll wait here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waited half an hour, watching with anxious and paternal eyes the
      activities of his fellows at the wagon. Once the sounds of woe drifted up
      to him and he moved farther up the canon. Here he waited, and presently
      The Wounded Bad Man joined him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What luck, Bill?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A boy,&rdquo; responded The Wounded Bad Man. &ldquo;Come on down an' look at him,
      Tom. He's worth it. He's man size.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about that misfortunate girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She ain't a-goin' to last long, Tom. She's a-goin' fast, an' she wants to
      see you&mdash;all of us&mdash;together. She's quiet now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus reassured, The Worst Bad Man returned with The Wounded Bad Man to the
      Tanks. With uncovered head he approached the wagon, dreading to gaze upon
      that tragic face, drawn with agony. But lo! as he parted the curtains he
      gazed upon the miracle of motherhood. Gone were the lines of suffering;
      the girl's face was transfigured with the light of that joy and peace and
      pride that God gives to new-made mothers, and for the first time in all
      his hard life The Worst Bad Man was permitted to glimpse something of the
      glory of his Creator.
    </p>
    <p>
      The babe, wrapped in a coarse crash towel, lay in the hollow of the little
      mother's arm, its red, puckered little face rested on her snowy bosom, the
      while she gazed downward at her treasure. It came to The Worst Bad Man
      very suddenly that once upon a time a woman had gazed upon him with that
      same look of yearning and joy ineffable; and with the thought he reached
      for the mother's left hand and carried it to his cracked and blistered
      lips. He spoke no word, but as he bowed his reckless head reverently over
      that fevered hand he seemed to cry aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is my wasted and worthless life. I offer it in exchange for yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl mother's calm, benevolent eyes beamed their gratitude. She
      understood, and like a true mother she accepted his tribute&mdash;only the
      sacrifice could not be for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; she asked wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom Gibbons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yours?&rdquo; turning to The Wounded Bad Man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bill Kearny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced inquiringly at The Youngest Bad Man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bob Sangster,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you save my baby?&rdquo; Slowly, searchingly, the wonderful eyes
      confronted each Bad Man in turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll save him,&rdquo; promised The Youngest Bad Man. With all the rashness, the
      unthinking, unreasoning confidence and generosity of youth, he passed his
      word. He recked not of the long trail ahead with death for the pacemaker.
      He only knew that this woman of sorrow had gazed longest upon him,
      estimating the strength in his lithe, big body, searching for his manhood
      in the face where sin had not yet laid its devastating hand. So he passed
      his word, and passing it in all the regal simplicity of the brave, the
      mother knew that he would keep it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll help,&rdquo; croaked The Wounded Bad Man humbly. He glanced at The Worst
      Bad Man, who bowed his head once more over the little hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll help too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you&mdash;all of you&mdash;to be my baby's godfathers. Poor little
      son! He'll be all alone in this big world when his mamma leaves him, and
      he's going to miss her so. Aren't you, sweetheart? Nobody to tuck you into
      bed at night, nobody to teach you your prayers, nobody to kiss the little
      sore spots when you fall and hurt yourself, nobody to tell your little
      secrets to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She closed her eyes. A tear stole through between the long lashes, and The
      Wounded Bad Man turned away. The Youngest Bad Man went and sat down on the
      wagon tongue and wept, for he was young. Only The Worst Bad Man stayed,
      watching, waiting. And presently the mother spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you all here? It's getting dark&mdash;and we must be moving on&mdash;to
      the next waterhole. You&mdash;Bob Sangster&mdash;take baby. You said you'd
      save him&mdash;didn't you? And Bill Kearny&mdash;and&mdash;Tom&mdash;Gibbons&mdash;will
      you be his godfathers&mdash;and&mdash;help&mdash;Bob&mdash;Sangster&mdash;on
      the&mdash;trail? Will you?. Promise&mdash;me&mdash;again&mdash;and... his
      name?... Call him Robert&mdash;William&mdash;Thomas&mdash;Sangster... and
      when he's&mdash;a fine&mdash;big&mdash;brave man&mdash;like his&mdash;godfathers&mdash;you'll
      tell&mdash;him&mdash;about his little mother who&mdash;wanted to live&mdash;for
      him so.... Lift him up&mdash;godfathers&mdash;and let me&mdash;kiss my&mdash;baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worst Bad Man waited until the last fluttering little sigh was
      finished before he removed the infant. The Wounded Bad Man closed the
      mother's eyes and folded her hands across her pulseless breast. The
      Youngest Bad Man stood, grasping the brake-rod until his knuckles showed
      white with the strain of the grip. Long he stood there, gazing at that
      calm, spiritual face with its halo of glistening brown hair, pondering
      deeply on the mysteries of birth and life and death. To him it all seemed
      a monstrous thing; and when The Worst Bad Man came to him with a shovel he
      wept aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Death is a terrible thing, Tom,&rdquo; he sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Life's worse,&rdquo; said The Wounded Bad Man gently. He was seated apart, with
      the baby in his arms, shielding it from the sun with his broad sombrero.
      &ldquo;Death can only get you once, but Life is a ghost dance. I wonder what it
      has in store for you, kidlets. I wonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Youngest Bad Man departed down the arroyo with the shovel and The
      Worst Bad Man, discovering a hammer and nails in the toolbox under the
      scat, removed the side boards and some strips from the wagon bed and fell
      briskly to work. When The Wounded Bad Man had satisfied himself that The
      Youngest Bad Man was nor within hearing, he spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Tom. Did you notice her when she asked us to save the baby? She
      picked on Bob. Seems as if she knew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I noticed. I guess she knew. They say angels always does know. It's
      forty-five miles to New Jerusalem, Bill, and you can't make it, and I'm&mdash;I'm
      too old for a long stretch without water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's why I said I'd help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Same here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've got to do the first two heats, Tom. We've got to save young Bob's
      strength for the final dash. I'll carry the baby an' you carry the grub
      an' things tonight, an' tomorrow night&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll carry everything tomorrow night; after that it'll be up to Bob. He's
      young and hard and game. He ought to make it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Late in the afternoon, with clumsy tenderness they buried the martyred
      mother there by the Terrapin Tanks, built a cairn over the grave and
      crowned it with a cross. Then they returned to the dismantled wagon to
      hold a consultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Wounded Bad Man was the first to broach the subject closest to the
      hearts of all three.
    </p>
    <p>
      With characteristic directness he shot his query at them. All his wicked
      life he had been facing desperate issues; long since he had learned to
      face them unblinkingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Robert William Thomas's got to have a bath, ain't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Youngest Bad Man took hold of the brake rod again and steadied
      himself. The Worst Bad Man looked at the wounded godfather in vague
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never figgered on that at all,&rdquo; he said simply. &ldquo;I was thinkin' about
      how we're to feed him. I'm for tubbin' him all right, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held up the two canteens. His pause was eloquent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he's such a little feller it won't take much,&rdquo; protested The Wounded
      Bad Man. &ldquo;He'll fit nice in a dishpan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish he was old enough to stagger along a few days without bathin',&rdquo;
       mourned The Youngest Bad Man. &ldquo;Maybe he can. I don't know a thing about
      infants; but if he must be bathed, why I guess we'd better&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'lowed to ask his mother a few questions regardin' his up-keep and
      what-all,&rdquo; interrupted The Wounded Bad Man apologetically, &ldquo;but I clean
      forgot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worst Bad Man wagged his head as if to convey the impression that this
      was a pardonable oversight indeed. He was thinking.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/0008.jpg" alt="0008 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0008.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It stands to reason,&rdquo; he announced presently, &ldquo;that this infant's mother
      naturally made some provision for his reception into camp. It's my opinion
      that gettin' a bath is the least o' the troubles confrontin' our godson.
      He's just naturally got to eat, an' wear somethin' better'n a towel
      that'll plum scratch the hide off'n him. There ought to be somethin' for
      Robert boy in that tail-box.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they searched the tailbox and discovered many things&mdash;condensed
      milk, a carton of soda crackers, a quart bottle of olive oil, a feeding
      bottle, two &ldquo;bluffers&rdquo; with real ivory rings, and an assortment of baby
      clothes, many of them hemstitched and worked through long months of loving
      anticipation. The silence was pregnant of tears as The Worst Bad Man held
      up a wee woolen undershirt and two little stockings that might have been
      cut from the index fingers of a pair of woolen mittens. The trio surveyed
      them wonderingly before returning to the search of the tailbox.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, here we are, Tom, all fine and dandy,&rdquo; announced The Wounded Bad Man,
      fishing up a book from the recesses of the tailbox. &ldquo;'Doctor Meecham on
      Carin' for the Baby.' Let's see what the doc has to say about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's another,&rdquo; said The Worst Bad Man, picking up another book and
      skimming through the first few pages, &ldquo;but it don't say nothin' about&mdash;&mdash;It's
      a Bible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tossed it from him contemptuously, and The Youngest Bad Man, still
      under the spell of his youth and its resultant curiosity, retrieved the
      Bible. The Worst Bad Man, in the mean time, peered over the shoulder of
      The Wounded Bad Man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn to the part on bathin' the baby, Bill,&rdquo; he commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum! Ah-hem! Let me see. All right, Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bathin' the Baby&mdash;Too much care cannot be exercised in performin'
      this most important part of the baby's toilette&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in blazes is a toilette?&rdquo; demanded The Worst Bad Man. The Wounded
    </p>
    <p>
      Ban Man thereupon looked into the tailbox as if in search of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess our baby ain't got no toilette in his war bags,&rdquo; he replied
      sadly. &ldquo;A toilette,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;is a little green tin bathtub about as
      long as my arm. Cost about <i>dos pesos</i> in any hardware store.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;Bob. You hear that?&rdquo; admonished The Worst Bad Man. &ldquo;When you
      get to New Jerusalem, you send out to Dan-by first-off an' round up the
      best toilette money can buy. Remember that, Bob. Crack right along. Bill.
      What does the doc say next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The First Bath&mdash;The first bath should not be administered until the
      baby is at least three days old&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bill,&rdquo; said The Worst Bad Man, looking solemnly at his companion, &ldquo;if I
      had a sick tomcat I wouldn't send for Doc Meecham. Three days without a
      bath! That's all right when the boy's a grown-up an' ain't supposed to
      bathe between waterholes when he's in the desert, or every Saturday night
      when he's in town, but with new babies I'll lay you my silver spurs tis
      different. The doc's wrong, Bill. But come again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus encouraged, The Wounded Bad Man read;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Immediately after birth the nurse should rub the entire body with olive
      oil, or, if that is not available, with some clean, pure grease or lard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Wounded Bad Man closed the book, but kept his finger in to mark the
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It don't sound regular, Tom, I'll admit; but there's a bottle of olive
      oil in the tailbox, so it looks like Robert William Thomas was due for a
      greasin' up in accordance with the doctor's orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worst Bad Man pondered. &ldquo;Well, I ain't convinced nohow,&rdquo; he said
      presently. &ldquo;This godson o' ours is startin' life slippery enough with us
      for his godfathers.&rdquo; He pondered a moment or two longer. &ldquo;Still, it we
      follow the book it may save Robert from chafin' an' gettin' saddle galls
      on him. Hand over the ile, Bob, an' we'll slick the young feller up a
      mite. It's just the tenderness o' hell we don't have to use axle-grease!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Wounded Bad Man held the naked babe in his lap, across which he had
      spread the towel, and The Worst Bad Man applied the oil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roll him over, Bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Wounded Bad Man rolled him over, and in a few minutes the task was
      completed. Dressing the infant, however, was infinitely more laborious.
      The godfathers, knowing something of the biting chill of the desert
      nights, were grateful for the profusion of woolen clothing and delicate
      woolen baby blankets which their search of the tailbox had netted, and
      when in due course The Youngest Bad Man had succeeded in dressing the
      infant after a nondescript fashion of his own, The Worst Bad Man corked
      the olive oil bottle, wiped his hands on his trousers, and beamed with the
      consciousness of a duty well performed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, The Wounded Bad Man ran his horny thumb down the index of Doctor
      Meecham on Caring for the Baby, until he came to the chapter entitled:
      &ldquo;Feeding the Baby.&rdquo; This chapter he real aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is comfortin',&rdquo; he remarked, turning down the leaf to mark the page.
      &ldquo;Doctor Meecham says that there's times when a baby won't thrive on
      nothin' else but condensed milk. We got plenty o' that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, an' we can maul up some o' them sody crackers an' make some pap for
      him,&rdquo; replied The Worst Bad Man; &ldquo;an' in a pinch we can bile him a pot o'
      gruel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll need water for that, Tom,&rdquo; The Wounded Bad Man reminded him; &ldquo;an'
      we'll need water to dilute this here condensed milk an' warm it up for the
      feedin' bottle. I 'low some of the godfathers's goin' to suck niggerhead
      cactus enough to do 'em quite a spell before they hit New Jerusalem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right,&rdquo; The Worst Bad Man replied gravely; &ldquo;Robert William
      Thomas's got to have the water, an' Jerusalem's the nearest camp, an' it's
      about forty-five mile as the crow flies. Malapa; Springs is back there
      thirty-odd mile, though&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain't no women at Malapai Springs,&rdquo; retorted The Wounded Bad Man
      pointedly, &ldquo;and we can't fool no time in the desert with this infant. It's
      up to us to hike&mdash;an' hike lively&mdash;to New Jerusalem. We've got
      six cans o' condensed milk, an' we can't get morn't three shots o' milk
      from each can. It's going to spoil quick after it's opened. Besides, if we&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Youngest Bad Man had just been the recipient of a serious thought. He
      hastened to get it off his mind. Boylike he interrupted and rose to a
      question of information.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's a godfather, Bill? What job does he hold down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're an awful ignorant young man, Bob,&rdquo; replied The Wounded Bad Man
      reproachfully. &ldquo;You been raised out in the woods somewheres? A godfather,
      Bob, is a sort of reserve parent. When a kid is baptized there's a
      godfather an' a godmother present, an' for an' on behalf o' the kid they
      promise the preacher, just the same as the kid would if he could only
      talk, to renounce the devil with all his works an' pomps&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's his works and pumps?&rdquo; demanded The Youngest Bad Man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;robbin' banks an' shootin' up deputy sheriffs, et cetry, et
      cetry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Youngest Bad Man smiled wanly. &ldquo;Well, Bill, all I got to say is that
      us three're a lovely bunch o' godfathers. Best thing we can do is to shunt
      the job to a godmother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there ain't no godmother,&rdquo; said The Worst Bad Man sadly. &ldquo;It's up to
      us. She&rdquo;&mdash;he jerked an oily thumb toward the little mound of sand and
      rock&mdash;&ldquo;she said somethin' about teachin' him his prayers an' bringin'
      h'm up a big, brave, strong man&mdash;like&mdash;like his godfathers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's part of the job, too,&rdquo; The Wounded Bad Man informed them. &ldquo;I
      went to a Sunday-school when I was a kid, an' I know what I'm talkin'
      about. A godfather's got to keep his eye peeled an' see that his godchild
      gets a reeligious education.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said The Youngest Bad Man, &ldquo;I reckon we'd better tote along this
      here Bible. I just come across somethin' interestin'. It's about Jesus
      Christ ridin' into Jerusalem. Listen:&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And The Youngest Bad Man proceeded to read from the Gospel according to
      St. Matthew:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto
      the Mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples, Saying unto them, Go
      into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass
      tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them unto me. And if any
      man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and
      straightway he will send them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rot!&rdquo; snapped The Worst Bad Man. &ldquo;I don't believe a word of it. You try
      swipin' a man's jacks, with or without a colt, in this country, an' see
      what happens if you say the Lord hath need of them. The Lord won't save
      you nohow. But cut out this religious talk, Bob, an' rustle up some
      sagebrush for a fire. We'll heat some of this airtight milk and feed our
      godson before we leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fire was lit forthwith, and the condensed milk prepared according to
      the instructions laid down by Doctor Meecham. The Worst Bad Man poured the
      water, while the other two godfathers guarded jealously every drop. He
      heated the mixture to the proper temperature, warmed the feeding bottle in
      it and then filled the bottle. The Wounded Bad Man sat with the baby in
      his lap and pressed the feeding bottle to the little stranger's lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an anxious moment to the three godfathers. Would he or would he not
      &ldquo;take hold?&rdquo; He did, promptly, with a gusto that brought a howl of delight
      from The Worst Bad Man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sure do admire to see the way that young feller adapts himself to
      conditions.&rdquo; said The Wounded Bad Man proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hops right to it, like a drunkard to a Fourth of July barbecue,&rdquo; said The
      Youngest Bad Man. &ldquo;He'll do.&rdquo; There was all the pride of fatherhood in the
      boy's tones. &ldquo;Game little pup, ain't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His poor little ma was game,&rdquo; remarked The Worst Bad Man &ldquo;He comes by it
      natural. I wonder what kind of a coyote his old man was. It'd sure be a
      sin if this boy grew up to be as big a fool as his father. I'd turn over
      in my grave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's up to the last of the godfathers,&rdquo; said The Wounded Bad Man.
      &ldquo;Mind you learn him hoss-sense, Bob. Don't let him grow up to wear
      eyeglasses before he's twenty-one years old, an' make him say 'sir' when
      he speaks to you. Teach him hoss-sense and respect, Bob. Them's the two
      great requirements to a man's education.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The way he's downin' his provender,&rdquo; The Worst Bad Man remarked, &ldquo;he'll
      be full up in five minutes and want to go to sleep. It's too hot to resk
      him out just now, an' Doc Meecham says he's go to be fed every four hours.
      We'll set up the drinks to Robert agin at four o'clock, an' then we'll git
      out o' this hole a-flyin'. Pendin' our departure, Bob, my son, you pull
      off to one side an' study all that Doctor Meecham has to say about carin'
      for the baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knowledge ain't so awful heavy, my son, when you carry it in your head,
      an' this Doc Meecham book weighs more'n two pounds. Bill'll take a little
      sleep, an' I'll keep the flies off'n him an' the infant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was almost sun-down when the three godfathers left Terrapin Tanks with
      their godson and struck off through the low black hills toward the
      northeast. A cold night wind was springing up, and to the thirsty
      godfathers, not one of whom had tasted water since sun-up that morning,
      the cool breeze was refreshing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up the wild, lonely draws they trudged, the sleeping infant, wrapped in a
      double blanket, reposing in the hollow of The Wounded Bad Man's sound arm.
      The man's face was drawn and very haggard, and he staggered slightly from
      weakness once or twice in spots where the trail was rough. The Youngest
      Bad Man, following at his heels, was quick to notice this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, I ain't carryin' an ounce o' weight,&rdquo; he expostulated. &ldquo;Bill's
      carryin' th' water an' the airtight milk an' the feedin' bottle an' the
      camp kettle and our grub, an' you're carryin' the baby an' a bundle of
      extra clothes. Lemme spell you a few miles, Bill. You're in bad shape with
      that sore shoulder, an' you're goin' to wear yourself out too soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Wounded Bad Man shook his head. &ldquo;I'll carry him as far as I can while
      I got the strength to do it. I ain't carryin' more'n fifteen pounds, but
      it'll be enough for you before you get to New Jerusalem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, ain't you comin' with us?&rdquo; demanded The Youngest Bad Man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; The Wounded Bad Man retorted firmly, &ldquo;I ain't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worst Bad Man turned in the trail, unscrewed the cap of the canteen
      and held the canteen toward the Wounded Bad Man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we can spare just one mouthful, Bill,&rdquo; he said kindly. &ldquo;You bein'
      hit through the shoulder that-a-way, naturally we don't hold you so rigid
      to the rule.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Wounded Bad Man had been nuzzling the baby's forehead with the tip of
      his great sunburnt nose. Now he raised his head quickly and his face was
      terrible to behold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've done a heap o' ornery things in my day,&rdquo; he growled, &ldquo;but I ain't
      stealin' the water that belongs to my godson. Don't you insult me no more,
      Tom Gibbons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That reminds me,&rdquo; remarked The Worst Bad Man affably, &ldquo;you're carryin'
      some extra weight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He reached forward, unbuckled The Wounded Bad Man's belt, with its forty
      rounds of pistol cartridge and the heavy revolver, and tossed it into the
      greasewood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That helps some!&rdquo; The Wounded Bad Man growled out the words again.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked on in silence hour after hour. Presently as they trudged along
      The Worst Bad Man began lighting matches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nine o'clock,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Third drink-time for Robert William Thomas.
      We'll make a dry camp an' heat some more milk&mdash;listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From a draw to the right there came, borne on the night wind, the sound of
      savage growling and yelping, as of dogs quarreling ever a bone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coyotes,&rdquo; The Youngest Bad Man elucidated. &ldquo;They got somethin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Move along out o' here,&rdquo; cried The Wounded Bad Man irritably. &ldquo;I don't
      want to listen to that. They'll get me soon enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They moved farther up the draw and camped for half an hour. Again The
      Wounded Bad Man fed the baby, and once more they swung away on their sorry
      road to New Jerusalem. Toward morning the baby awoke and whimpered, and
      The Wounded Bad Man, who never once during the long night had relinquished
      his trust, sought to soothe it with song.=
    </p>
    <p>
      ```Oh, Ella Ree, so kind an&rdquo; true,
    </p>
    <p>
      ````In th' little churchyard lies.
    </p>
    <p>
      ```Her grave is bright with drops o' dew,
    </p>
    <p>
      ````But brighter were her eyes.=
    </p>
    <p>
      ```Then carry me back to Tennessee,
    </p>
    <p>
      ````There let me&mdash;&mdash;=
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a melody of his childhood. His mother had sung it to him in the old
      lost days of his youth and innocence, and the plaintive ballad came
      cracked and quavering through lips swollen with suffering. It was a
      mournful song, but it seemed appropriate, for The Wounded Bad Man was
      thinking of the little mother away off there in the silence at Terrapin
      Tanks. Whether from this or physical inability to proceed farther, his
      voice broke in the second line of the chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dog my cats,&rdquo; he gasped feebly, &ldquo;I can't sing a lick no more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll sing for him,&rdquo; volunteered The Youngest Bad Man; &ldquo;I'l give him 'The
      Yeller Rose o' Texas'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They made fifteen miles that first night, and at sun-up they emerged from
      the black volcanic hills out on to a great, white, shimmering, dry salt
      lake. A mile away a little cabin, dazzling white in the glint of the
      rising sun, flared against the horizon, and far to the northeast the Witch
      of Old Woman Mountain sat watching them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over there on the southeast spur of Old Woman you'll find New Jerusalem,
      Bob,&rdquo; The Worst Bad Man explained. &ldquo;That mountain with the rocky crest
      that looks like a witch in profile&mdash;that's Old Woman Mountain. Watch
      the Witch, Bob, an' you'll get there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Youngest Bad Man nodded. &ldquo;We can't carry the baby in this heat,&rdquo; he
      reminded them. &ldquo;Hand him over, Bill, and I'll just buck-jump along to that
      little cabin an' hole up with him till you an' Tom catch up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll carry him,&rdquo; The Wounded Bad Man retorted doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll not.&rdquo; The Youngest Bad Man was aroused. &ldquo;You're dyin' on your
      feet, Bill Kearny, an' I ain't goin' to see you stand by an' fall with my
      godson an' hurt him maybe. Come across with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reluctantly The Wounded Bad Man surrendered the child to The Youngest Bad
      Man. The latter was drawn and weary himself, but he had what neither of
      his comrades possessed&mdash;he had glorious Youth. He would still be on
      his feet and traveling with his godson when the coyotes would be
      quarreling over the others. He trotted off now, in a hurry to reach the
      lone cabin before the heat became too oppressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worst Bad Man looked after him enviously. &ldquo;What a man!&rdquo; he muttered.
      &ldquo;Lean an' long an' tough. If we strike some niggerhead cactus he'll get
      through. He can last two days more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't see no niggerhead cactus,&rdquo; complained The Wounded Bad Man.
      &ldquo;It's ten miles across this salt lake, an'&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He swayed and fell on his hands and knees. The Worst Bad Man helped him
      up. They stood for a moment, leaning against each other, resting; then
      plodded weakly on. The Worst Bad Man was the first to speak. His tongue
      was dry and swollen but he could still speak plainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D'ye remember, Bill, that yarn that Bob read us outen that Bible last
      night&mdash;about Christ ridin' into Jerusalem an' Him send-in' two men
      over to the nearest camp for a jinny with a colt? It kinder set me
      thinkin', an' I been wonderin' all night. Bill, do you believe in God?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; The Wounded Bad Man replied thickly. &ldquo;I usen't to, but I dunno
      now'. I seen things yesterday&mdash;in that woman's eyes when she talked
      about the baby not havin' anybody to teach him his prayers an' him growin'
      up a fine, good man. I been wonderin', too, Tom. You don't suppose, Tom,
      that the Bible's wrong and that Christ sent three disciples instead o'
      two?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo;&mdash;The Wounded Bad Man paused and looked at his companion
      very impressively&mdash;&ldquo;I kinder feel like me an' you an' Bob was
      disciples&mdash;since I seen that girl an' held that little mite of a kid
      in my arms. I been figgerin' it out, Tom, an' I allow that Bob ought to
      make Jerusalem with Robert William Thomas some time Christmas mornin'. The
      thought's comforted me a heap. Somehow I sorter got the notion that there
      can't no hard luck come to a Christmas baby, an' Christ just naturally
      can't go back on us if we play the game fair by that kid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worst Bad Man nodded grave approval to these sentiments. The Wounded
      Bad man continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sorter sets my mind back thirty-five years. My folks used to take me
      to church when I was a kid. I wasn't a churchgoer by nature, but there was
      one picture on the wall of that church of a naked baby lyin' in his
      mother's lap, an' when the sun'd come streamin' in through them
      stained-glass windows it used to light up their faces kinder beautiful.
      An' yesterday mornin' when the sun&rdquo;&mdash;here The Wounded Had Man
      stumbled and fell once more. He picked himself up and continued wearily&mdash;&ldquo;and
      when the sun come streakin' over the Terrapin Tanks an' shone into that
      wagon, I swear to God, Tom, it was the same two faces!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worst Bad Man made no reply. Privately he was of the opinion that his
      companion was delirious. The latter's next remark, however, precluded this
      idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ain't done right by young Bob Sang-ster,&rdquo; he complained. &ldquo;We're a pair
      o' hard old skunks, Tom, an' we've kinder influenced that boy. He ain't
      bad. There ain't nothin' naturally crooked in Bob. He's just young, an'
      thinks he's havin' adventures an' makin' a big man of himself. That job at
      Wickenburg was the first trick he ever turned. Before you boys leave me
      I'm goin' to talk to Bob. I'm going to talk while I got my voice, because
      by noon my tongue'll be out of kilter&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll talk to him too,&rdquo; assented The Worst Bad Man eagerly. &ldquo;I was
      thinkin' the same thoughts as you, Bill. The last o' the godfathers can't
      be no crook. Bill. He's got to do his duty by the infant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An hour later they arrived at the white cabin on the dry salt lake. It was
      not the kind of house one sees in cities, for it was built entirely of
      blocks of rock salt, of such crystal clearness that as the two godfathers
      approached they could discern the vague outlines of Boh Sangster sitting
      inside with the baby. The roof of the house was of canvas, sun-baked,
      rotten and filled with holes. Evidently the strange habitation had been
      the abode of some desert visionary, who planned to file on the salt lake
      and sell his concession to the Salt Trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Youngest Bad Man gave the baby into the keeping of The Wounded Bad Man
      once more, while he and The Worst Bad Man busied themselves spreading the
      double blanket over the ruined canvas roofing to keep out the sun. Next
      they prepared some condensed milk and set the feeding bottle out in the
      hot salt gravel until it should be heated to the right temperature. And
      while they waited, sitting there in silence, The Wounded Bad Man leaned
      back against the salt wall and closed his tired eyes. The Worst Bad Man
      stooped and took the baby from him; yet he did not seem to be aware of
      this action. This was a bad sign. The Youngest Bad Man shook his head
      dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently The Wounded Bad Man spoke. His speech was very thick and
      labored, like that of a paralyzed man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bob,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I had somethin' to say to you, but I'm too weak to preach
      now. Tom'll tell you. Got that Bible yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Bill, I got it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Bob. I'm just goin' to find out if there's a God, and if there
      is I guess he'll give me a square deal. I'm goin' to give Him three
      chances to prove He's on the job, an' I got to win two heats out o' three
      before I'll believe. Open that Bible, Bob, an' read me the very first
      thing you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Youngest Bad Man opened the Bible and read from the Gospel according
      to St. Matthew:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Jesus called a little child unto Him, and set him in the midst of
      them, &ldquo;And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become
      as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same
      is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.&rdquo;

    <p>
      The Youngest Bad Man closed the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open it again,&rdquo; The Wounded Bad Man commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Youngest Bad Man opened it at random and read from the Gospel
      according to St. Luke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If
      thou be Christ, save thyself and us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the other answering rebuked him, saying, &ldquo;Dost not thou fear God,
      seeing thou art in the same condemnation?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but
      this man hath done nothing amiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy
      kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To-day shalt thou be
      with me in paradise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That'll do, Bob,&rdquo; murmured The Wounded Bad Man. &ldquo;I call upon you an' Tom
      to witness that I receive that woman's baby&mdash;in God's name. If I
      whimper for water don't give it to me. There's blood poison in my shoulder
      an' arm an' I'm goin' crazy. I'm burnin' up&mdash;but it's comin' to me.
      Lord, it's comin' to me. I don't complain none, Lord, an' I thank Thee for
      bringin' me this far&mdash;with the little chap&mdash;for Thy sake, Lord.
      Our Father, who art&mdash;who art&mdash;who art&mdash;who art&mdash;in
      Heaven, blessed&mdash;I can't remember, Bob. It's a long time.... I'll try
      another&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's off at last,&rdquo; muttered The Worst Bad Man. &ldquo;It's the blood poison.
      He's been dyin' since we left Malapai Springs. Listen at him, Bob. What
      kind o' stuff is he talkin'?&mdash;listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They bent over The Wounded Bad Man and listened intently, for it seemed to
      them he was wandering far afield in his delirium. He was. Bill Kearny's
      body was dying, but his soul was wandering adown the wild and checkered
      path of his career to its dim and distant starting point.=
    </p>
    <p>
      ````"Now I lay me down to sleep,
    </p>
    <p>
      ````I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
    </p>
    <p>
      ````If I should die before I wake,
    </p>
    <p>
      ````I pray the Lord my soul to take."=
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless my father and mother and my little sister&mdash;and make me a
      good boy. Amen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worst Bad Man's face twitched a little &ldquo;Good Jesus Christ!&rdquo; he
      murmured. The words were not a blasphemy. They fell from his blackened
      lips like a benediction&mdash;in his fierce eyes a soft and human light
      was beaming. &ldquo;Jesus Christ <i>is</i> good. He's slippin' it easy to old
      Bill. He's made him a child again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the long, stifling day they sat and watched him, and when he
      became delirious The Youngest Bad Man took the baby in hand, in case The
      Wounded Bad Man should suddenly become violent. Late in the afternoon when
      the baby had been fed and wrapped again in the blanket, preparatory to
      taking the trail once more, the dying godfather rolled over and opened his
      eyes. They bent to hear his last message. It was almost unintelligible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a Christmas baby&mdash;it belongs&mdash;in Jerus&mdash;alem. Stick
      it out to&mdash;finish&mdash;good&mdash;boys&mdash;don't let&mdash;my&mdash;godson&mdash;die&mdash;between&mdash;two&mdash;thieves&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They pressed his hand. The Worst Bad Man had the pack ready and slipped it
      over his weary shoulders. He reached for the baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gimme the kid,&rdquo; he cried thickly. &ldquo;I got ten miles left in me yet. I'll
      see you across the dry lake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Youngest Bad Man understood now. He handed over the baby, and together
      the two godfathers passed out of the shack into the great salt desert...
      And some time during the night the angels came and led Bill Kearny into
      paradise.
    </p>
    <p>
      After leaving the cabin The Worst Bad Man, realizing that the next ten
      miles of their journey across the salt lake offered free, smooth footing,
      resolved to make the pace while the &ldquo;going&rdquo; was good. They were no longer
      hampered by being forced to suit their gait to that of Bill Kearny, and
      The Worst Bad Man was resolved to see his godson safe across the dry lake
      before surrendering.
    </p>
    <p>
      He swayed considerably as he walked, but The Youngest Bad Man strode
      beside him, with a hand on his arm, and helped to hold him steady. And as
      they proceeded The Worst Bad Man talked to Bob Sangster.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a short sermon, evolved, in terse, eloquent sentences, from out the
      bitterness of The Worst Bad Man's dark past and still darker future.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bill Kearny never went back on a pal, son, an' when I quit you I want you
      to say, 'Well, Tom Gibbons, he never went back on a pal nuther.' An' when
      you come to cash in, you want to have our godson say, 'An' Bob Sangster,
      too&mdash;he never went back on a pal.' Cut out the crooked work, son.
      Nobody has anythin' on you yet&mdash;start straight an' raise this boy
      straight, an' if ever you spot him showin' signs o' breakin' away from the
      reservation, just you remind him that a woman an' two men died to make a
      man outer him. That's all. I ain't goin' to try to talk no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At midnight The Worst Bad Man was very weak. He swayed and staggered and
      stopped every few hundred yards to rest, but he would not give up the
      baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll last till sun-up,&rdquo; he told himself; &ldquo;I got to. I ain't the quittin'
      kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      About two o'clock in the morning the moon came out; from somewhere in the
      distance a coyote gave tongue, and The Worst Bad Man shivered a little. At
      three o'clock they came out of the dry salt lake into the sands again, and
      The Youngest Bad Man held out his arms for the baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He needs grub mighty bad,&rdquo; was what The Worst Bad Man tried to say, but
      the words came only as an unintelligible mumble. There had been no sage on
      the dry lake and they had been unable to make a fire. For two hours the
      baby had been whimpering with hunger and cold. The Worst Bad Man slipped
      out of his pack, gathered some dry sagebrush and lit a roaring fire, while
      his youthful companion ministered to the baby. And when Bob Sang-ster had
      finished The Worst Bad Man smoothed a two-foot area in the sand, and by
      the light of the campfire he wrote with his finger the words that he could
      not speak:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You carry baby. I'm good two three miles more with pack. I leave you
      twelve miles from New Jerusalem. Don't lay up today keep moving put baby
      half rations savvy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Youngest Bad Man nodded. When dawn began to show in the east they
      resumed the journey. After the first mile, The Worst Bad Man gave signs
      that the end was coming very soon. He fell more frequently, barking his
      hands and knees, filling his mouth and eyes with sand, tearing his flesh
      in the catclaws. Weary, monotonous gasps came from his constricted throat,
      but still he staggered along, although his strength had been gone for
      hours. He was traveling on his nerve now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly the dawnlight crept over the desert, softening with its magic
      beauty the harsh empire of death. The Worst Bad Man saw the rosy glow
      lighting up the saturnine face of the witch of Old Woman Mountain, and was
      content. He had promised himself to last till dawn. He had kept his word.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sank to his knees in the sand. Bob, Sangster stooped and lifted him to
      his feet. He staggered along a few yards and fell again, and when Bob
      Sangster would fain have lifted him once more, The Worst Bad Man motioned
      him back with an imperious wave of his hand, for he did not want the boy
      to waste his strength. He tried to protest verbally, but a horrible sound
      was all that came from his swollen mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Youngest Bad Man tarried for a moment, irresolute, standing over him.
      The Worst Bad Man deliberately removed his hat and handed it to the young
      godfather, who took it, fitted a branch of sagebrush with three forks at
      one end into the crown of the wide-brimmed hat, and thus constructed a
      sort of crude parasol wherewith to keep the sun from the baby. The Worst
      Bad Man nodded his approbation, and Bob Sangster lowered the baby until
      its soft little face brushed the bloody bristles on The Worst Bad Man's
      cheek; a handclasp&mdash;and the last of the godfathers turned his young
      face toward New Jerusalem and departed into the eye of the coming day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worst Bad Man watched him until he disappeared into the neutrals of
      the desert before he turned his head to glance back, along the trail by
      which they had come. Away off to the southwest, forty miles away, the
      Cathedral Peaks lifted their castellated spires, and the gaze of the
      stricken godfather went no farther. The Cathedral Peaks&mdash;how like a
      church they seemed, standing there in the solitude, sublime,
      indestructible, eternal, gazing down the centuries. The Worst Bad Man was
      moved to solemn thought&mdash;he who had so little time for thought now.
      His mind harkened back to the scene in the salt house on the dry lake, to
      Bill Kearny's challenge to the Omnipotent, to the answers that came to
      that anguished soul crying in the wilderness of doubt and unbelief; and
      suddenly a great desire came over The Worst Bad Man. He, too, wanted to
      know. He, too, would ask a sign. And if there was a God&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stretched forth his arms toward the Cathedral Peaks. &ldquo;Lord, give me a
      sign,&rdquo; he gobbled; &ldquo;let me have The Light&rdquo;; and, as if in answer to his
      cry, the sun burst over the crest of the Panimints, a long shaft of light
      shot across the desert and painted, in colors designed by the Master
      Artist, the distant spires of the Cathedral Peaks. They flamed in crimson,
      in gold, in flashes of silver light, fading away into turquoise and deep
      maroon, and in that light The Worst Bad Man read the answer to his riddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, I believe.&rdquo; The horrid gobbling broke the silence once more.
      &ldquo;Remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then the desert madness smote his brain, and with the sudden, terrible
      strength of the maniac he scrambled to his feet and started across the
      waste toward the peaks. Over the long trail to the Great Divide he ran,
      with arms outstretched; and as he ran the Peaks flamed and flickered in
      heliograph flashes. Perhaps they carried a message, a message that only
      The Worst Bad Man could understand&mdash;the message of hope eternal
      sounding down the ages:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Today shalt thou be with me in paradise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently The Worst Bad Man fell. It was the end. He had kept the faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But Bob Sangster could not wait and watch and speculate. Time pressed; at
      Terrapin Tanks he had passed his word, and he must be moving on if he
      would save his godson. He had one can of condensed milk and half a quart
      of water left. It behooved him to hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the sun was an hour high and the desolate landscape lay baking and
      shimmering round him, he crept into the meager shadow of a palo-verde
      tree, undressed the infant, rubbed him with the last of the olive oil and
      threw the bottle away. Then with new, fresh garments carried from Terrapin
      Tanks he dressed the baby. He wet his bandana handkerchief and washed the
      little red face. He was preparing for the final dash.
    </p>
    <p>
      He abandoned the supply of mesquit-bean bread and jerked beef, the Bible,
      and Doctor Meecham's invaluable work on Caring for the Baby. He considered
      a moment, and decided to abandon also the heavy woolen blanket in which
      they had been carrying the baby. It mea'nt six pounds less weight, and
      unless they made New Jerusalem before sundown Robert William Thomas would
      not need it. With or without blankets, they would both sleep cold under
      the stars tonight, for Bob Sang-ster was once more confronted by the
      primal necessity of his calling. He had to &ldquo;take a chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was about to discard his six-shooter and belt, but a stealthy crackle
      in the sagebrush caused him to reconsider. He watched the spot whence the
      sounds came and presently he made out the form of a coyote. The brute was
      sitting on his hunkers, his red tongue lolling out of the corner of his
      mouth, his glance fixed in lazy appraisal upon the last of the godfathers
      and the bundle that he carried.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boldness of the beast was an insult in itself. It drove Bob Sangster
      wild with anger. With marvelous brute intelligence the coyote had sensed
      the weakness of the man, and patiently he had set himself the task of
      shadowing him to the finish. He sat there now&mdash;waiting. In his
      contempt for the hereditary enemy the gray skulker did not even trouble to
      conceal his intentions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you're hangin' round for the pickin's already,&rdquo; snarled Bob Sangster,
      and fired. The coyote turned a somersault and crawled away through the
      sage, dragging its hindlegs after it, and two more coyotes sprang up at
      the sound of the shot and scurried out of range.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think I'll drop this boy, don't you?&rdquo; raved the godfather, blazing
      away at the fleeing enemy long after it was out of range. He seized Robert
      William Thomas and, holding his hat parasol over the child, hurried along
      toward the mouth of a draw. He was getting in among the low, black,
      volcanic hills and lava beds again, and the reflected heat was terrible.
      Cautiously he made his way along the shady side of the canon, and for an
      hour he progressed thus until the sun, having risen higher, sought him
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horned toads and lizards scuttled out of his path in fright, chuckwallas
      blinked their eyes at him, a desert terrapin waddled leisurely by, and
      once, gazing back over the trail, he saw that the coyotes had recovered
      from their fright and were following him again. He commenced to see
      mirages&mdash;wonderfully beautiful little lakes, fringed with palms and
      bright-green rushes. Distinctly he heard the pleasant murmur of water
      tumbling over rocks. He was tempted to pause and search for this purling
      brook, but his common-sense warned that it was all a delusion of the heat
      and his own imagination. He knew that the sun was getting him fast, that
      he was drying up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cactus,&rdquo; he kept repeating to himself, as if in that one word he held the
      open sesame of life; &ldquo;just one niggerhead cactus.&rdquo; But the niggerhead
      cactus, with its scanty supply of vegetable juices, did not grow in the
      country through which he was traveling, and as the slow miles slipped
      behind him and his eager glance revealed the entire absence of the shrub
      that meant life to him and Robert William Thomas, the terrible uselessness
      of his struggle, the horrible forlornness of his forlorn hope, became more
      and more apparent. The baby was whimpering continually now, and faint blue
      rings had appeared under the little sufferer's eyes. He was sick and tired
      and hot and itchy, and despite the fact that the godfathers had done their
      best, Bob Sangster knew that the child could not last a day longer without
      proper attention. It was a miracle that he had survived thus far&mdash;a
      miracle only accounted for by reason of the fact that he was a healthy,
      hearty twelve-pounder at birth. The last of the godfathers tried vainly to
      soothe him with the oft-successful Yeller Rose o' Texas, but he was beyond
      singing now, and in the knowledge that both were going swiftly he mingled
      his tears with those of his godson. Yet they were manly tears, and no
      taint of selfpity brought them forth. Only it broke Bob Sangster's heart
      to think of his helpless godson and of the gray scavengers skulking
      behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the godfather thrilled with a great feeling of relief and joy. He
      had come to an Indian water sign; he read it at a glance. Five little rock
      monuments in a circle, with a sixth standing off to the right about thirty
      feet from the others. In that direction the water lay, and bearing due
      southwest Bob Sangster saw a draw opening up. The journey would take him a
      mile or two out of his way, but what mattered a mile or ten miles,
      provided he found water? The prospect gave him renewed hope and strength.
      He forged steadily ahead and when the canon narrowed he knew he was coming
      to a &ldquo;tank.&rdquo; Up the wash he ran and sank, sobbing, on the edge of the
      water-hole. It was quite dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a long time before he could gather his courage together and depart
      down the canon again. He had traveled two miles for nothing! He wept anew
      at the thought, marveling the while that there should be so much moisture
      still in his wretched body.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the mouth of the canon he halted and prepared the last of his condensed
      milk and water for the baby. When he proffered it, however, the child
      screamed and refused the horrid draught, and as he lay on the man's knees
      with his little mouth open Bob Sangster dropped in the last dregs of his
      canteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need water, too, son,&rdquo; he mumbled sadly. &ldquo;This sweet dope is killin'
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He replaced the feeding bottle in his pocket, paused long enough to kill
      another coyote that had ventured too close, and resumed his journey toward
      New Jerusalem. He had left the dry tank at noon. At one o'clock he was two
      miles nearer New Jerusalem; at three o'clock he was within five miles of
      the camp and had fallen for the first time. But even as he fell he had
      thrust out his left hand, thus fending his weight from the baby, and the
      child had not been injured. So the godfather merely covered the child's
      tender head with Tom Gibbons' old hat, and together they lay for a while
      prone in the sand. The man was not yet done, but he was exhausted and half
      blind and very weak. He was striving to get his courage in hand once more,
      and he needed a rest so badly. So he lay there, trying to think, until
      presently the whimpering of the infant aroused him, and he sat up
      suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seated in a circle, of which Bob Sangster and the baby formed the axis,
      were half a dozen coyotes. They were closer now&mdash;too close for
      comfort and, cowardly as he knew them to be, there were enough of them
      present to fan their courage to the point where a single rush would end
      it. He fired at them and they scampered away unharmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't shoot any more,&rdquo; the man wailed. &ldquo;I'm goin' blind. Come, son, we
      must move on or they'll get us to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He picked the child up and plodded on, and once more the coyotes fell into
      line behind him. The godfather began to feel afraid of them. He was
      obsessed with a horrible fear that they might sneak up and snap at him
      from behind, or rush him en masse and tear the baby out of his arms. He
      kept glancing back and firing at them. But all of his shots went wild and
      gradually the tracing brutes grew bolder. Whenever he sat down for a few
      minutes to rest they surrounded him, and it seemed to the godfather that
      each time they edged in closer. He decided to save his cartridges until
      the final rush.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tottered along until four o'clock before he fell again. This time he
      twisted in time to land on his back, with the baby uppermost, and as he
      lay there, stunned and shaken, the godfather was almost proud of himself
      for his forethought. He closed his eyes to rid his vision of the myriads
      of red, yellow and blue spots that came dancing out of the sand and
      shooting into the air like skyrockets. The spots still persisted, however&mdash;for
      the skyrockets were in his brain, and as he lay there it came to him that
      this was to be the end after all. He was too weak to carry the baby
      further. Sooner or later he would fall upon it and kill it, so why
      struggle further&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The baby was leaving him! He could feel it being slowly dragged from his
      protecting arm, and with a moan that was intended for a shriek he sat up
      and reached for his gun. So close to him was the coyote, dragging gingerly
      at the infant's clothing, that the godfather dared not fire. He merely
      threw up his arms to frighten the beast away, and reluctantly it trotted
      back and rejoined its companions of the slavering, red-tongued circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The godfather knelt in the sands beside the baby and searched for the
      marks of teeth, but found none. The horror of their situation was brought
      forcefully home to him now. He had hoped before, but hope was vanished.
      New Jerusalem could not be more than three miles away, but it might as
      well be three hundred, for Bob Sangster could never make it with the baby.
      He thought no longer of life. He wanted to cheat the coyotes, and in his
      agony he forgot that he was a Bad Man and cried aloud to a Supreme Being
      of whom he knew nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O God, save me, save me! Not for myself, but for this poor little baby.
      I'm old and tough, Lord, but save the baby. You were a baby yourself once,
      Lord, if the Bible don't lie. Now save my baby. Don't go back on me, Lord.
      Help me, help me to keep my word to raise him right&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He clasped the child in his arms and kissed it passionately for the first
      time since his assumption of the duties of a godfather And then, because
      he was a fighter and could not quit while there was life within him, he
      reeled onward with dogged persistence. He fixed his fading glance on some
      unimportant landmark ana nerved himself to last until he should reach it.
      Queer thoughts kept obtruding themselves upon him. Once he thought a
      chuckwalla addressed him, saying: &ldquo;Hello, Bob Sang-ster, what are you
      runnin' away from? You can't dodge them coyotes. They're goin' to get that
      infant, sure. Better chuck 'em the kid an' see if you can't make it alone
      to New Jerusalem. That baby's weight is killin' you, boy. After all, what
      is he to you? He's only a three-day-old baby. Why don't, you drop him an'
      beat it in to New Jerusalem? You can make it without the baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had cursed the chuckwalla and stamped it into the earth for the insult.
      But a moment later a horned toad advised him to drink the milk that still
      remained in the feeding bottle. &ldquo;Of course it's none o' my business,&rdquo;
       remarked the horned toad, &ldquo;but if the baby won't drink it, you should.
      It's foolish to let it go to waste. It's only a couple of mouthfuls, but
      it'll give you strength to make that black lava point a mile ahead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horned Toad,&rdquo; replied the godfather, &ldquo;you're a sensible little critter
      an' I'll take your advice. It ain't manly to do it, but nothin' matters
      any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drank the milk that the baby had refused, tossed the bottle aside and
      nerved himself to last until he should reach the black lava point. That
      was to be the last goal. If he fell before he reached it he resolved to
      climb into a palo-verde tree, wedge himself and the baby in between the
      limbs, kill the baby and himself, and thus dying have the laugh on the
      coyotes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fell. For the third time the child escaped being crushed. The
      palo-verde tree was only fifty yards away, the black lava point
      seventy-five yards, but when the godfather could scramble to his feet
      again he made for the palo-verde tree. Here, to his disgust, he found
      himself too weak to climb the tree. So he leaned against it and wept,
      dry-eyed, with rage and horror and disappointment. The horned toad had
      followed and now offered more advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sangster, you're a chump. Why climb the tree? The buzzards will get you,
      so what's the difference?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll make the lava point,&rdquo; replied the godfather. &ldquo;They can't come at me
      in back there, an' I can keep 'em away for a while anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lurched away. Foot by foot he approached the black lava point. He
      resolved to round it; there was shade on the other side. Staggering,
      reeling, muttering incoherently, he rounded the lava rock and collided
      with something soft and hairy. He leaned against it for a moment, resting,
      while something soft and warm and animallike nuzzled him and nickered
      softly in the joy of the meeting. When Bob Sangster opened his eyes he
      found himself leaning against a trembling old white burro with a pack on
      his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Water,&rdquo; thought the godfather, &ldquo;water. There ought to be a canvas
      waterbag,&rdquo; and he went clawing along the burro's side, feeling for the
      waterbag but unable to find it. The little animal was standing patiently
      in the shadow of the rock, and Bob Sangster stood off and looked at him.
      The burro's eyes were red and dust-rimmed; evidently he had traveled far.
      His legs trembled, his tongue, dry and black, protruded from his mouth.
      The burro, too, was dying of thirst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You poor devil,&rdquo; mused Bob Sangster. He gazed at the pitiable little
      animal, the while his memory strove to recall some other incident in which
      a burro had figured. There had been some talk of burros recently with Bill
      Kearny and Tom Gibbons. What was it? Well, never mind. It didn't make any
      difference. This burro was dying and useless; there was no water bag&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem... then sent Jesus two
      disciples, saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and
      straightway ye shall find an ass tied....</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The words of the Gospel according to St. Matthew flamed in letters of fire
      across the failing vision of the last godfather. He remembered now. He had
      read a chapter from the Bible to Bill Kearny and Tom Gibbons back there at
      Terrapin Tanks&mdash;and it was all about Christ riding into Jerusalem on
      an ass. Here, in the shadow of this black lava, he had found a burro
      waiting!
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill Kearny had asked for a sign&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The last of the godfathers thought of his frenzied prayer of an hour
      before. He had asked for help. Could it be possible that here stood the
      answer?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a chance,&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;This critter has stampeded from some
      prospector's pack outfit He's been lookin' for water, and the Lord sent
      him our way, sonny. He's sure sent him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With his free hand the godfather clawed desperately at the diamond hitch,
      swept the load from the packsaddle, ripped it apart and found&mdash;a can
      of tomatoes. He slashed the can open, drank some himself and gave the
      balance to the burro. Then, lifting his godson into the packsaddle, he
      lashed him in securely; after which he took his open pocket knife in hand
      and prodded the jaded burro until it consented to move away across the
      desert at a crawling, shuffling gait. Bob Sangster walked beside the
      burro, one hand busy with the point of the knife, the other clinging
      desperately to the rear cross of the packsaddle. His strength had, in a
      measure, returned after drinking the canned tomatoes, and he fancied that
      the burro too seemed rejuvenated. Bob Sangster wished he had another can
      of tomatoes to offer the little beast, for the lives of himself and his
      godson depended on the burro. He leaned heavily against the animal, which
      half led, half dragged him along. Thus an hour passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were ascending the upraise that led to the crest of the southeast
      spur of Old Woman Mountain now, and through the sunset haze the witch's
      demoniac face leered down at them from the heights above. Slowly,
      haltingly, they progressed up the slope. The burro was almost spent, and
      time and again he balked and groaned a feeble protest He welcomed the
      occasions when the godfather's weak clasp of the packsaddle was broken and
      he fell headlong to earth. But if he fell, the godfather rose again,
      moaning, praying, raving, and still the awful cavalcade pressed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shadows grew' long. The sun disappeared and evening settled over the
      desert, but still the sorry pilgrimage continued up the slope. Now they
      were half a mile from it, a quarter, two hundred yards, a hundred from the
      summit&mdash;the burro grunted, shivered and lay down. In the gathering
      gloom Bob Sangster felt for the ropes which bound the baby to the pack,
      cut them and stood clear of the dying beast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've pulled me up the slope in the heat, old fellow,&rdquo; he tried to say
      with lips that were split and parched and cut and bleeding. &ldquo;I never could
      have made it. New Jerusalem can't be far away now. I'll get there. But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pressed the muzzle of his gun into the suffering animal's ear and
      pulled. &ldquo;I owed you that kindness,&rdquo; he mumbled, and passed on to the crest
      of the slope.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the summit he paused, swaying gently with his precious burden, and
      gazed down the other side of the spur. In a hollow a few hundred yards
      below him, the lights of New Jerusalem gleamed brightly through the
      gathering gloom of that lonely Christmas Eve, and the godfather recalled
      the words of Bill Kearny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a Christmas baby. God won't go back on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bob Sangster's tongue hung from his mouth, long and black and withered,
      like the tongue of a dead beef, as he stood there on the outskirts of New
      Jerusalem and thought of many things. Bill Kearny had been right. It was a
      Christmas baby. It would pull through all right. He drew the baby to him
      until their faces were very close, so close that a little hand crept up
      and closed tightly over the godfather's nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was to be their last supreme moment together, for after tonight some
      woman must enter into Robert William Thomas' life and Bob Sangster could
      only be a partner in his godson's love. He recalled that the baby's mother
      had told The Worst Bad Man they had &ldquo;kin&rdquo; in New Jerusalem, and Bob
      Sangster wondered if she had intended that he should turn the baby over to
      them. The thought appalled him, and his hot tears fell fast on the little
      white face as he staggered down the grade into New Jerusalem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't give you up,&rdquo; he gibbered, &ldquo;I won't. You're mine. Your mother
      give you to me to raise like a man, an' I'm a-goin' to do it. You're my
      kid an' you're named after us three. No, no, I won't. I've died ten
      thousand deaths for you&mdash;I'll work an' I'll hire a woman&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fifteen minutes later a battered, bleeding, raving wreck of a man, who
      hugged a bundle to his great breast, reeled into New Jerusalem and paused
      in front of a hurdy-gurdy. From within came the plaintive notes of a
      melodeon, and a woman&mdash;a Mary Magdalen&mdash;was singing:=
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Jerusalem, Jerusalem, lilt up your gates and sing,</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Hosanna! Hosanna! Hosanna to your King!</i>=
    </p>
    <p>
      Bob Sangster made his uncertain way to the woman at the melodeon and held
      a bundle toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's this?&rdquo; she demanded. The last of the godfathers gobbled and
      mumbled, but the words refused to come. How could the woman know what he
      was trying to say?
    </p>
    <p>
      She unwrapped the bundle and gazed down at Robert William Thomas Sangster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who knows? Perhaps in that moment the woman, too, like The Three Bad Men,
      beheld The King!

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
